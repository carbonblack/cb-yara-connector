# Installing Yara Agent (Centos/RHEL 6)

The Yara agent must be installed on the same system as Cb Response.

* Create directories

	```
	mkdir -p /usr/share/cb/integrations/yara/yara_rules
	```
	
* Download Yara Agent

	```
	wget -O /usr/share/cb/integrations/yara/yara_agent https://github.com/carbonblack/cb-yara-connector/releases/download/2.0.1/yara_agent
	```
	
* Download Yara Logo

	```
	wget -O /usr/share/cb/integrations/yara/yara-logo.png https://github.com/carbonblack/cb-yara-connector/releases/download/2.0.1/yara-logo.png
	```
	
* Create Yara Agent Config File


#### Sample Yara Agent Config
Copy and modify the following config to `/etc/cb/integrations/yara/yara_agent.conf`

```ini
[general]
; either run a single worker locally or remotely
; valid types are 'local' or 'remote'
worker_type=local

; ONLY used for worker_type of local
; Cb Response Server settings for scanning locally.
; For remote scanning please set these parameters in the yara worker config file
; Default: https://127.0.0.1
cb_server_url=
cb_server_token=

; ONLY used for worker_type of remote
; IP Address of workers if worker_type is remote
;broker_url=redis://

; path to directory containing yara rules
yara_rules_dir=yara_rules

; Cb Response postgres Database settings
postgres_host=
postgres_username=
postgres_password=
postgres_db=
postgres_port=

; os nice value used for this script
niceness=1

; Number of hashes to send to the workers concurrently.  Defaults to 8.
; Recommend setting to the number of workers on the remote system.
concurrent_hashes=8

; If you don't want binaries to be rescanned more than once, regardless of the rules used, set this to True
disable_rescan=True

; The agent will pull binaries up to the configured number of days.  For exmaple, 365 will pull all binaries with
; a timestamp within the last year
; Default: 365
num_days_binaries=365

; ADVANCED: A vacuum script can be enabled to "clean" the database and prevent fragmentation
; This can be disabled if the seconds value is 0 or less
vacuum_seconds=0
vacuum_script={HERE}/scripts/vacuumscript.sh
```

> NOTES:
> 1) The use of `{HERE}` is a placeholder representing the location of this package's `main.py` file,
> allowing for the use of relative paths to the package itself.
> 2) Paths can use `~` to access your home directory, so you locate files there as well.

#### Running Yara Agent Manually

	./yara_agent --config-file=/etc/cb/integrations/yara/yara_agent.conf

#### Example Cron Entry

    ```

* Install Git and GCC

	```
	sudo yum install git
	sudo yum install gcc
	```

* Install Python 3.6

	```
	sudo yum install epel-release
	sudo yum install python36
	sudo yum install python36-devel
	```
	
* Install Redis
	
	```
	sudo yum install redis
	sudo systemctl start redis
	sudo systemctl enable redis
	```
	
	
* Install Supervisord

	```
	sudo yum install supervisor
	```
	
* Install Yara Worker

	```
	git clone https://github.com/carbonblack/cb-yara-connector.git
	cd cb-yara-connector
	git checkout yara_version2
	python3.6 -m venv venv
	source ./venv/bin/activate
	pip install -r requirements.txt
	deactivate
	mkdir yara_rules
	```
	
	
* Create Yara Worker Config File `yara_worker.conf`

#### Example Yara Worker Config File

	[general]

	;
	; Python Celery Broker Url. Set this full url string for Redis
	; Example: redis://<ip_address>
	;
	broker_url=redis://127.0.0.1
	
	;
	; Cb Response Server Configuration
	; Used for downloading binaries
	;
	cb_server_url=
	cb_server_token=
	
	;
	; Directory for temporary yara rules storage
	; WARNING: Put your yara rules with the yara agent.  This is just temporary storage.
	;
	yara_rules_dir=yara_rules
	
* Copy, modify and save to `yara_worker.conf`
	
#### Run Yara Worker Manually

	celery -A tasks worker --config-file=yara_worker.conf --concurrency=10 --loglevel=info
	
#### Example Supervisor Config

	[program:yara_workers]
	stdout_logfile=/var/log/yara_worker.log
	stderr_logfile=/var/log/yara_worker.log
	user=<username>
	directory=/home/<username>/cb-yara-connector
	command=/home/<username>/cb-yara-connector/venv/bin/celery -A tasks worker --config-file=yara_worker.conf --concurrency=10 --loglevel=info
	autostart=true
	autorestart=true
	
* Copy the above, modify and add to `/etc/supervisord.conf`

* Enabled Supervisor

	```
	systemctl enable supervisord
	```
	
* Restart Supervisor

	```
	systemctl restart supervisord
	```
