# Yara Package Local Storage
This folder is here for storing any locally created artifacts.  It is marked with `.gitignore`
so that any files here are not pushed to the remote repository.

If you wish to use this folder in any configuration files, start your path with 
`{YARA}/local/` -- it is suggested that you create subfolders to organize your usage
of this location.
