# Yara Package Local Storage
This folder is here for storing any locally created artifacts.  It is marked with `.gitignore`
so that any files here are not pushed to the remote repository.

Enter `{YARA}/local` for any configuration path that that you wish to use this location, 
using subfolders for clearer organization.  One subfolder, `yara_rules` is already provided
for local rule files.
